    <h1 class="forum_title">Bio</h1>
    <p class="descriptions">I was born and raised in Clearwater, FL (the greatest state), but I lived in Gainesville, FL during high school.
        I'm the oldest of 6 children so I went off to college to set an example for my siblings.
        When I'm not in class or doing homework, I'm making YouTube videos!</p>
