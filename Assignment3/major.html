    <p class="descriptions">Originally I came to Spelman College as a Biology major, but soon realized that my dreams of going to medical school simply weren't my dreams anymore. I switched to Computer Science because my step mom (a software developer) concvinced me that it's the way to go. Turns out, it's not so bad!</p>
